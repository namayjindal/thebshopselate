# The Bishop's Elate
A creative platform for the students of the Bishop's Co-Ed School, Kalyani Nagar, Pune

An initiative I undertook in my senior year of high school to encourage and foster collaboration between students amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, and as a way to promote school spirit among them. The platform encouraged students to pursue recreational and academic projects, along with becoming one of the first Alumni Outreach initiatives conducted by the school.
